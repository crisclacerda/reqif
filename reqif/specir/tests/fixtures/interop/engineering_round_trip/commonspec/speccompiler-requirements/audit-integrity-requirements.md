## Audit & Integrity Requirements @SRS-001-sec9

### SOFTWARE_FUNCTION: Audit and Integrity @SF-006

> description: Encompasses content-addressed hashing for incremental build detection, structured [TERM-NDJSON](#TERM-NDJSON) logging for audit trails, include dependency tracking for proper cache invalidation, and structured diagnostic reporting for error traceability.

> rationale: Certification environments require reproducible builds and auditable processing trails for traceability evidence.

Deterministic compilation, reproducible builds, and audit trail integrity.

#### HIGH-LEVEL_REQUIREMENT: Content-Addressed Hashing @HLR-AUDIT-001

> description: The build engine computes SHA1 hashes for each document. Hashes are compared against cached values in the `source_files` table:

1.  If the content hash matches the cached hash, the system checks include file hashes
2.  If all hashes match, the document is skipped (cached [TERM-IR](#TERM-IR) state is reused)
3.  If any hash differs, the document is rebuilt from source
4.  After successful rebuild (no [TERM-21](#TERM-21) errors), hashes are updated in the `source_files` table

This provides O(1) change detection without parsing unchanged documents.

> rationale: Content-addressed hashing provides reliable change detection independent of filesystem timestamps. Deferred hash updates prevent cache poisoning from partial or failed builds.

> status: Approved

The system shall compute SHA1 content hashes for all source documents and include files to enable change detection.

#### HIGH-LEVEL_REQUIREMENT: Include Dependency Tracking @HLR-AUDIT-002

> description: Before [TERM-15](#TERM-15) execution, the include handler expands `.include` code blocks by:

1.  Resolving include paths relative to the source file directory
2.  Detecting circular includes via a processed-file set (raises error on cycle)
3.  Recursively expanding nested includes up to a bounded maximum depth
4.  Recording all include paths and their SHA1 hashes in the `build_graph` table (`root_path`, `node_path`, `node_sha1`)

Subsequent builds use this graph to check if any included file has changed, triggering a rebuild of the root document when needed.

> rationale: Include dependency tracking ensures that changes to sub-files correctly invalidate parent documents. Cycle detection prevents infinite recursion in include hierarchies.

> status: Approved

When a document contains include directives, the system shall track all included file dependencies in a build graph and detect circular includes.

#### HIGH-LEVEL_REQUIREMENT: Structured Diagnostic Reporting @HLR-AUDIT-003

> description: The diagnostics collector provides structured error/warning reporting:

1.  **Collection**: [TERM-16](#TERM-16)s report issues via `diagnostics:error(file, line, code, msg)` and `diagnostics:warn(file, line, code, msg)`
2.  **Structured data**: Each diagnostic record contains file path, line number, diagnostic code, and human-readable message
3.  **Severity control**: The `has_errors()` method enables the [TERM-15](#TERM-15) to determine abort conditions after the [TERM-21](#TERM-21) phase
4.  **Output integration**: Diagnostics are emitted through the structured logger with file and line context

Diagnostic codes follow domain prefixes (e.g., SD-102 for invalid enum, SD-201 for missing required attribute, SD-301 for dangling reference).

> rationale: Structured diagnostics with source locations enable IDE integration, CI/CD reporting, and user-friendly error resolution. Machine-parseable diagnostic codes enable automated error classification.

> status: Approved

The system shall collect and report processing errors and warnings with source location information throughout all pipeline phases.

#### HIGH-LEVEL_REQUIREMENT: Structured Logging @HLR-AUDIT-004

> description: The logging subsystem supports two output modes selected automatically or via configuration:

1.  **NDJSON mode** (non-TTY): Outputs one JSON object per line with fields: `level`, `message`, `timestamp`, and optional context. Suitable for CI/CD log aggregation and `jq` filtering
2.  **Console mode** (TTY): Outputs human-readable formatted messages with ANSI color coding (respects `NO_COLOR` environment variable). Includes timestamp and level indicator

Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR. Configured via `config.logging.level` with environment override `SPECCOMPILER_LOG_LEVEL`.

> rationale: NDJSON enables machine-parseable audit trails for certification environments. TTY-aware formatting provides developer ergonomics during interactive use. The NO_COLOR standard ensures accessibility compliance.

> status: Approved

The system shall provide [Newline-Delimited JSON](#TERM-NDJSON) structured logging with TTY-aware output formatting.

#### HIGH-LEVEL_REQUIREMENT: Build Reproducibility @HLR-AUDIT-005

> description: Build reproducibility is ensured through:

1.  **Deterministic parsing**: Content-addressable SHA1 identifiers ensure consistent object identity
2.  **Deterministic ordering**: [TERM-25](#TERM-25) with alphabetic tie-breaking produces the same [TERM-16](#TERM-16) execution order
3.  **Deterministic numbering**: Float numbers assigned by `file_seq` ordering, which is stable across builds
4.  **Deterministic output**: Pandoc invoked with the same arguments and reference documents produces identical output

Cache invalidation is based solely on content hashes, not filesystem timestamps or system state.

> rationale: Reproducible builds are a fundamental certification requirement in aerospace and safety-critical domains. Content-addressed processing ensures that build artifacts can be independently verified.

> status: Approved

Given identical source files, project configuration, and tool versions, the system shall produce identical outputs.
